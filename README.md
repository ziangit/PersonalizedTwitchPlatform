### Logout

## Future Features

I am constantly working to improve PersonalizedTwitchPlatform and expand its capabilities. Here are a few features I am planning to implement in the future:

### Better Search

The current app only carries some basic custom search, in future I may integrate some simple NLP content into the app to provide more convenient search

### Recommendation

I am working on the recommendation algorithm different from the twitch official to provide the best user experience

### Notification

In future, users can get their favorite uploaders' streaming notifications on Twitter, Discord, QQ, and other social apps.  


Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
